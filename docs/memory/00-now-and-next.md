# Now and Next

## Current State

- Repo now has Slack Local File Search v0 implemented and live-tested with a real internal Slack app.
- `docs/repo-goal/00-poc.md` defines the Slack-based Local AI Ops Agent three-day POC.
- `docs/repo-goal/01-accelerated-local-file-search.md` narrows the immediate plan to a Slack bot that can locally search allowlisted files and explains the Local Agent runtime decision.
- `docs/repo-goal/02-v0-facts-and-hardening.md` defines the next phase: facts inventory, remaining manual UAT, coverage gap review, demo runbook, and Phase 5 readiness decision.
- `README.md` now describes the Local Agent runtime, Slack Socket Mode flow, setup, run, test, demo commands, For Coding workspace setup notes, daemon commands, and live UAT result.
- `.gitignore` now protects local dependencies, build outputs, secrets, SQLite runtime files, logs, caches, and local OAuth/token artifacts.
- Source code includes config validation, guarded direct local search, Slack `/agent find <query>` command handling, and JSONL audit logging.
- A real Slack app named `Slack Beaver Local Agent` exists in the `For Coding` workspace with Socket Mode enabled and `/agent find <query>` configured.
- `docs/runbooks/slack-local-file-search-v0.md` now provides the repeatable v0 demo runbook.
- `launchctl submit` is documented as optional demo convenience only; foreground `npm run dev` remains the reliable v0 demo path.

## Validation Status

- Application logic and tests now exist.
- Automated verification passed with `npm test` and `npm run typecheck`.
- Live Slack UAT passed for `/agent find Socket` in Slack `#社交`, returning 3 matches from the allowlisted `docs` folder.
- `logs/audit.jsonl` recorded the successful search without full file contents.
- `@slack/bolt` runtime loading required an ESM/CommonJS interop fix, committed as `923cce3 fix(slack): load Bolt app in ESM runtime`.
- Fixture UAT passed for successful search, no result, denylist skip, oversized skip, and empty query rejection.
- Remaining Slack-visible UAT was not completed in the latest execution because Chrome UI automation was unavailable.

## Likely Next Work

- Execute Phase 4.5 demo hardening.
- Run the remaining Slack-visible manual UAT cases from `docs/runbooks/slack-local-file-search-v0.md`.
- Decide whether invalid `/agent` attempts should be audited.
- Replace ad hoc `launchctl submit` with either foreground-only docs or a real LaunchAgent plist template.
- Keep Phase 5 local index cache deferred until v0 Slack-visible UAT and daemon/runbook gaps are closed.
